This is the first of hopefully many blog posts outlining my progress in updating my programming skills. I'll be working on improving my knowledge of Javascript and React with the eventual goal of becoming a NextJS expert.

This blog has been built with the help of the (excellent) [NextJS tutorial](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app) but I plan to adapt it to be database-driven and with a little more functionality than a simple listing of posts.

Watch this space... ðŸ‘€
