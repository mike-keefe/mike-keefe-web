So it's not entirely unheard of for me to start a project and quickly move on to something else. Some might say it characterises me perfectly.

In this case, despite my best intentions I've not updated this blog in a while. I'm pleased to say it's for good reason - I've taken a full time position at [Cuckoo](https://cuckoo.co) to which I've been devoting my full attention for the past couple of months.

That doesn't mean I've given up learning Javascript or updating my development skills more generally, and my plan is to pick up where I left off over the coming months as I settle in to my new role.

In the meantime, I've made a reluctant return to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mike-keefe/) so you can follow me there for possibly-more-frequent updates!
