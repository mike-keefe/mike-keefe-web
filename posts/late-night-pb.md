I was beginning to think I'd miss a run today for the first time in 2022. Storm whatever-its-called made the idea of going anywhere both dangerous and unappealing, but I finally made it out of the house a little after 22:30.

Somewhat unexpectedly, I ran a new 5K personal best (27:37) and even saw my Garmin-reported VO2 Max score increase by one to 43mL/kg/min. I think I could have beaten 27:30 if I hadn't slowed to duck under a downed tree in Ladywell Park.
